## 🌐 Requirements

This application runs on modern web browsers. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. For the best experience, please ensure your browser is up-to-date.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Click to generate different shapes and see them come to life in real-time.
- **Educational Tool:** Learn about fractals, recursion, and self-similarity through engaging graphics.
- **Customizable:** Adjust parameters to generate a variety of shapes beyond the Sierpinski triangle.
- **Browser-Based:** No need for complex installations; just run it in your web browser.

## 📖 How It Works

The chaos game uses a simple set of rules to create fractals. It starts with a triangle and randomly chooses points to build complex shapes. This is a fascinating example of how simple processes can lead to beautiful outcomes.

## 🎨 Exploring Shapes

After launching the application, you can easily interact with the interface:

- **Generate New Shapes:** Each click will create a new visual representation based on randomness and mathematical principles.
- **Adjust Settings:** Use sliders or input boxes (if available) to modify the parameters controlling the visualization.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure that your browser is updated.
2. Clear your browser’s cache to eliminate any loading problems.
3. Restart your browser or try a different one if it doesn’t open.
